//So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
//When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

		//Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
		//For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
        //A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
