How is Polymorphism possible in java? --->By Method overloading and OverRidding
Polymorphism in Java has two types:-->  1)Compile time polymorphism (static binding)    2) Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding).

1)Compile Time->when we are calling all methods of parent and child class by creating child class object inside main method is callesd static or compile poly.		
		
2)When Child class object refered by parent class  referance variable is called Dynamic Polymorphism(Run time or Top Casting) 
eg->Two Wheeler parent1 = new Bike();  ->creating to call same method of child class and parent class  inside main method
	
IMP-> Down Casting -->parent class object is reffered by child class reference variable is called down casting *Error*-->we have to do casting eg(Bike)
eg-->Bike child1 - (Bike) new TwoWheeler();  
              child1.wheels();                    not print thorw exception--->CLASS CAST EXCEPTION
	
	INTERVIEW-->1)direct question ->what is down casting and why you not recommended?
	2)if parent class Object is reffered by child class refernece variable what is called ? Down casting
	3)What is exception encountred during DownCasting ? -->class cast exception
