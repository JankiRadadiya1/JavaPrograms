/*	Java garbage collection is an automatic process. Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, 
	-identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects.

	
		There are generally four ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection.
		Nullifying the reference variable
		Re-assigning the reference variable
		An object created inside the method
		Island of Isolation
		
		
---------Advantages of Garbage Collection in Java----------------------
The advantages of Garbage Collection in Java are:
1)It makes java memory-efficient because the garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
2)It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM), so we donâ€™t need extra effort.
