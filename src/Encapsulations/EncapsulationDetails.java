package Encapsulations;
//what is encapsulation :->data and function we combine in one entity-->when we create class data(properties)and functions(methods)combined and puted in one unit is class same is encapsulations
public class EncapsulationDetails {
//	so when we are hiding data from user is concept of encapsulation with help of access modifier
	
	/* packages:-> in java to make codeing in desent way like perfet manner is to create perfect pacakages with name like .compackagename
	in pacakages we right related code like Eg:-> in one website there are many things like one thing which handle buttons other thing which handle colour and handling looks
	other thing which handle data so this is three parts of website for this if we have to make inbulid function
	 for proerties of website we make different pacakge and for buttons proprties we make different pacakge for buttons and 
	 user data eg add,modify,delete functionality for that create new pacakges 	
	there are two types of packages:->1) which exsist already in java which is bulidin pacakages
	                                  2) user making by himself
	 inbulid pacakges like if we use scanner we import java.util so this is package which already there in java 
	
	*/
	
	
	
	//   by creating one pacakge and we can import one pacakge to another and acess all the public things like methods and functions from one package to another

//main purpose of encapsulation to hideing data from user with help of access modifier
